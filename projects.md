Below is a selection of projects that I am actively working on. In the case of open sourced projects you can find them on my [github profile](https://github.com/mlowen), where you can also find any older projects which I am no longer actively working on.

## CommonMark.Editor

* Javascript, [GitHub](https://github.com/mlowen/CommonMark.Editor)*

CommonMark.Editor is a basic web editor for [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) designed to fit nicely into a site using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It is loosely inspired by the markdown editor available at GitHub.

## Glint

* Python, [GitHub](https://github.com/mlowen/Glint)*

Glint is a micro framework for command line applications, which allows the developer to create command driven applications which I was unable to replicate with [argparse](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html).

## Knockout-SinglePage

* Javascript, [GitHub](https://github.com/mlowen/knockout-singlepage)*

Knockout-Singlepage is an extension to the [Knockout javascript library](http://knockoutjs.com/) which leverages the [component](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html) functionality that was introduced in v3.2 to enable single page applications.

## Knockout.CommonMark

*Javascript, [Github](https://github.com/mlowen/Knockout.CommonMark)*

Knockout.CommonMark provides Knockout bindings for CommonMark allowing markdown stored in the view model to be displayed as HTML.
