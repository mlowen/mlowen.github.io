## Me

On the off chance you haven't guessed based on the content of this site so far I'm a coder, what you might not realise is that I hail from the little slice of paradise that is [Hamilton, New Zealand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_New_Zealand) where I live with my wife and son. Currently I'm a Solutions Architect ~~Senior Software Developer~~ ~~Software Developer~~ at [LIC](http://www.lic.co.nz/) writing web apps for diary farmers and our staff, previously I've worked as a developer at [Torpedo7](http://www.torpedo7.co.nz/), [LayerX](http://layerx.co.nz/) and [The Nile](http://thenile.co.nz/) primarily doing web stuff in a variety of different technologies. If you want to know more about my professional life I would suggest checking out my [linkedIn profile](http://nz.linkedin.com/in/mikelowen).

In my spare time I'm one of those oddities that codes to relax as long as it isn't work related, as such my hard drive (and [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mlowen)) is littered with half finished projects. Outside of coding I like to think of myself as your average geek who enjoys tv, movies, novels (both graphic and prose), computer and board games. I'm also a fan of [rugby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union) having played the game from when I was a we nipper until my mid-twenties. While no longer playing I still enjoy watching, following my regional team the [Chiefs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiefs_(rugby_union)) and the national team the [All Blacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team). Recently I've discovered the joy of [homebrewing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrewing) and I'm currently at the beginning of the journey from kit brews to all grain brewing.
